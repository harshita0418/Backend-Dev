# Task 1: Unix Commands & Log Analysis

Situation
You joined a company as a Software Intern. Your senior asks you to analyze application logs stored on a Linux server.

Tasks:
1. Navigate to /var/log/app.
2. List all files (including hidden) with readable sizes.
3. Show the last 20 lines of error.log.
4. Search for the word "error" (case-insensitive) in all .log files.
5. Save the output to error_report.txt.


# Task 1 – Commands & Output

harshita@harshita:/mnt/c/Users/91766$ cd /var/log/app
-bash: cd: /var/log/app: No such file or directory

harshita@harshita:/mnt/c/Users/91766$ ls /var/log

harshita@harshita:/mnt/c/Users/91766$ sudo mkdir -p /var/log/app
[sudo] password for harshita:

harshita@harshita:/mnt/c/Users/91766$ sudo touch /var/log/app/error.log
sudo touch /var/log/app/app.log

harshita@harshita:/mnt/c/Users/91766$ echo "ERROR: Database connection failed" | sudo tee -a /var/log/app/error.log
echo "Info: Application started" | sudo tee -a /var/log/app/app.log
echo "warning: low memory" | sudo tee -a /var/log/app/app.log
echo "Error: timeout occurred" | sudo tee -a /var/log/app/error.log

harshita@harshita:/mnt/c/Users/91766$ cd /var/log/app
ls -lah
tail -n 20 error.log
grep -in "error" *.log > error_report.txt
cat error_report.txt

harshita@harshita:/var/log/app$ sudo chown harshita:harshita /var/log/app
harshita@harshita:/var/log/app$ grep -in "error" *.log > error_report.txt
cat error_report.txt

error.log:1:ERROR: Database connection failed

Explanation:
The log directory was owned by root, so writing the report file required elevated privileges. I used sudo to generate error_report.txt securely.



# Task 2: Git Basic Workflow & Undo Operations

Situation
You are working on a project and accidentally make mistakes while committing code.

Tasks:
1. Initialize a Git repository.
2. Add README.md and commit it.
3. Modify a file and check changes before committing.
4. Unstage a file after adding it.
5. Fix a wrong commit message.
6. Revert a commit safely.


1. Initialize a Git Repository
git init

2. Add README.md and Commit It
touch README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit with README"

3. Modify a File and Check Changes Before Committing
echo "Project description" >> README.md
git status
git diff

4. Unstage a File After Adding It
git restore --staged README.md

5. Fix a Wrong Commit Message
git commit --amend -m "Correct commit message"

6. Revert a Commit Safely
git log --oneline
git revert <commit-hash>

Conclusion
Git provides powerful undo commands such as restore, amend, and revert to fix mistakes without losing work.



# Task 3: Branching, Merging & Conflict Resolution

Situation
Two developers are working on the same file and a merge conflict occurs.

Tasks:
1. Create a branch feature-ui.
2. Make changes and commit.
3. Merge the branch into main.
4. Simulate a merge conflict.
5. Resolve the conflict manually.
6. Explain why merge conflicts occur.


1. Create Branch
git checkout -b feature-ui

2. Make Changes and Commit
echo "UI feature added" >> app.txt
git add app.txt
git commit -m "Added UI feature"

3. Merge the Branch into main
git checkout main
git merge feature-ui

4. Simulate a Merge Conflict

In main branch:
echo "Main branch update" >> app.txt
git commit -am "Updated app in main branch"

In feature-ui branch:
git checkout feature-ui
echo "Conflicting UI change" >> app.txt
git commit -am "UI conflicting change"

Try to merge:
git checkout main
git merge feature-ui

5. Resolve the Conflict Manually

File shows:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Main branch update
=======
Conflicting UI change
>>>>>>> feature-ui

After editing manually:

Main branch update
Conflicting UI change

git add app.txt
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"

6. Why Do Merge Conflicts Occur?

Merge conflicts occur when:
- Two branches modify the same line of a file
- One branch deletes a file while another modifies it
- Git cannot decide which change to keep automatically

Conclusion
Branching allows parallel development, while merging combines work. Merge conflicts are a natural part of collaborative development and can be resolved safely by manually reviewing and editing conflicting files.
